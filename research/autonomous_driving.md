# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Perception and Decision Making Intergration for Autonomous Driving

Our main focus is on researching 2D image perception and multi-sensor 3D surround perception methods. We aim to explore solutions that integrate perception and decision making end-to-end and create a universal framework for autonomous driving. Our goal is to advance autonomous driving technology into a new phase.

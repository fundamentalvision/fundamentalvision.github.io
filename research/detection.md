# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Foundation Model for Visual Perception

Object detection and recognition are the basic problems of visual perception. We focus on designing vision backbones and object detection models to solve these problems and extending them to universal and large-scale foundation models for general perception tasks.

# Fundamental Vision's Website

The Fundamental Vision Laboratory is leaded by Associate Professor Jifeng Dai, affiliated with Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. The laboratory is mainly engaged in the fields of computer vision and deep learning, dedicated to developing fundamental approaches to advance visual perception and artificial general intelligence. 

Currently, there are four main research directions: foundation model for visual perception, generic model for multi-modal perception, perception and decision-making integration for autonomous driving, and foundation model for general intelligent agents. The laboratory has published more than 60 academic papers. Some of the papers, represented by deformable convolution, have become benchmark methods in the field and have been integrated as standard operators in PyTorch.
